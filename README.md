# Postfix-DKIM
Quick Script to Set Up Postfix and DKIM on a fully patched Ubuntu 24.04 Server

Note that this script is mostly destructive and will impact existing Postfix and OpenDKIM settings. You'll still need to modify /etc/postfix/main.cf with mynetworks, etc.  This was just designed to speed up a process for me.  YMMV
